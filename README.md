# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game is played against a bot that makes its choice randomly.

## How to Play
The player chooses either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The bot also makes a choice. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
- Scissors cut Paper (Scissors win)
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
- If both the player and the bot make the same choice, it's a draw.

## Development
The game is developed using JavaScript. The logic of the game is contained in `index.js`. The bot's choice is generated using the random library in JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
Future improvements might include a graphical user interface, more complex bot behavior, and multiplayer support.
